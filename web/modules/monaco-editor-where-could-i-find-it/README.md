Because the size of monaco editor is too large to be contained in the project, please download from:

https://registry.npmjs.org/monaco-editor/-/monaco-editor-0.50.0.tgz

and put "package/min/vs" folder in the "modules/monaco-editor" directory, then move "loader.js" in "modules/monaco-editor/vs/" to the "modules/monaco-editor".

The structure should be [like there](./screenshot.png)
